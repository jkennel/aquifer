\usage{
grf_time_parallel(radius, storativity, K, thickness, time, flow_rate,
  flow_time_interval, flow_dimension)
}
\arguments{
\item{radius}{distance to monitoring interval}

\item{storativity}{aquifer storativity}

\item{K}{aquifer hydraulic conductivity}

\item{thickness}{aquifer thickness}

\item{time}{prediction times}

\item{flow_rate}{well flow rates}

\item{flow_time_interval}{time between flow rate measurements in samples}

\item{flow_dimension}{flow dimension}
}
\value{
theis solution for multiple pumping scenario
}
\description{
Parallel convolution of GRF well function and flow rates in the time domain.
Time series needs to be regularily spaced and so are the flow rates.  Some
performance gains can be achieved if the number of flow rate does not change
for each time.
